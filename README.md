# Filesystem Sunburst Visualization for Home Assistant

## Overview
This project integrates a Sunburst chart into Home Assistant using Plotly and a custom `sunburst-chart-card.js` file. It visualizes hierarchical filesystem data, fetched as JSON from a Python script, and renders it as an interactive chart in your Home Assistant dashboard.

## Features
- **Interactive Sunburst Chart**: Dynamically generated with Plotly.
- **Filesystem Data Visualization**: Hierarchical data displayed in a user-friendly format.
- **Customizable**: Configuration through Home Assistant YAML and external Python scripts.
- **Performance and Safety**: Data separation between frontend and backend for enhanced performance and security.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
1. Home Assistant installed and running.
2. Local access to your Home Assistant configuration directory.
3. Python 3.7+ installed on the host system.

### Step 1: Download Dependencies
Download the Plotly library and place it in the Home Assistant `www` directory. This is required to render the Sunburst chart in the frontend. Use the following commands:
```bash
mkdir -p /config/www
wget https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-2.24.1.min.js -O /config/www/plotly.min.js
```

### Step 2: Install the Sunburst Chart Card
Place the `sunburst-chart-card.js` file in the `www` directory of your Home Assistant configuration. Add the card as a resource in your `configuration.yaml`:
```bash
cp sunburst-chart-card.js /config/www/sunburst-chart-card.js
```
Add the following entry to your configuration:
```yaml
lovelace:
  resources:
    - url: /local/sunburst-chart-card.js
      type: module
```
Restart Home Assistant to apply the changes.

### Step 3: Configure the Card
In your Home Assistant Lovelace dashboard, add a new card using the following configuration:
```yaml
type: custom:sunburst-chart-card
jsonUrl: /local/filesystem_data.json
```
This configuration points the card to the JSON file generated by the backend script.

### Step 4: Generate Filesystem Data
Save the `filesystem_scanner.py` script to a directory on your server. This script scans your filesystem and outputs a JSON file compatible with the Sunburst chart. Place the script in a secure location, such as `/opt/scripts/filesystem_scanner.py`, and run it using:
```bash
python3 /opt/scripts/filesystem_scanner.py
```
Ensure the output file is saved to `/config/www/filesystem_data.json` so it can be accessed by the Sunburst card.

### Step 5: Automate with Crontab
To keep the filesystem data up-to-date, schedule the script to run periodically using `crontab`. Open the crontab editor:
```bash
crontab -e
```
Add a line to run the script every hour:
```bash
0 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/filesystem_scanner.py
```
This ensures the JSON data remains current without manual intervention.

## Separation of Concerns
The Sunburst chart card is designed with a clear separation of responsibilities between the frontend and backend to ensure performance and security:

The **frontend** is responsible for rendering the chart and displaying it interactively in the Home Assistant dashboard. It fetches the preprocessed data as a JSON file from the backend and does not access the filesystem directly. This design keeps the frontend lightweight and ensures no sensitive filesystem data is exposed through direct access.

The **backend** is responsible for generating and preprocessing the filesystem data into a JSON format suitable for the chart. This involves scanning the filesystem, calculating folder sizes, and building the hierarchical data structure. By running this process in a secure and isolated environment, the backend ensures sensitive operations are handled safely. Additionally, offloading heavy computations to the backend prevents performance issues in the frontend.

## Configuration Details
The `config.json` file allows you to customize various aspects of the script's behavior. Place this file in the same directory as the `filesystem_scanner.py` script. An example configuration is shown below:
```json
{
    "output_file": "/config/www/filesystem_data.json",
    "error_log_file": "/opt/filesystem/error_log.txt",
    "exclude_dirs": ["/var", "/proc", "/sys", "/dev", "/mnt"],
    "max_depth": 5
}
```
- **`output_file`**: The location where the JSON output will be saved. Ensure this path is accessible to the Home Assistant frontend via /local/ refered in the sunburst.
- **`error_log_file`**: The file where errors and warnings are logged during the scan.
- **`exclude_dirs`**: A list of directories to exclude from the scan. This helps avoid unnecessary processing of system-critical or irrelevant paths.
- **`max_depth`**: Limits the depth of the folder hierarchy to prevent excessive data generation and improve performance.
